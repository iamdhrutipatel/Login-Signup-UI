# Social Media Application Login, Signup UI Using Flutterüì±

Login, Signup UI Application using Flutter.

## Introduction
This application was my first attempt towards flutter and UI development. I've created a basic Social Media Login and Signup UI application and tried to make the UI user-friendly so that even a novice personüßçüèªcan use it.

## Screenshot

You can find the [Screenshot]() folder which includes the screenshots üì∏ of splash screen, login and signup for both android and ios devices.

- Download [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). Select the operating system of your device and install the SDK.
- Set up Path for macOS :
  1. view hidden files using cmd+shift+. 
  2. open .bash_profile if you are using bash in Terminal or .zshrc if using zsh. 
  3. Type the below command 

         export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_OF_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]/bin"
  4. Save the file, Refresh the terminal and type below command to check if flutter is working or not
  
         flutter doctor
